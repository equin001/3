<h1>€ddie$</h1>
<h3>Accept/Pay €ddie$</h3>
<b>€ddie$ is like having a € 50 bill to spend, but you don't get any change back. Whoever accept or pay for goods and services with €ddie$, doesn't receive back any fiat change. You can still exchange your €ddie$ for fiat currency. <b>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<b>Somebody buy something for $0,01, that falls in the range of 1 €ddie$. If it falls out the range of 1 €ddie$ even by $0,01 they must pay 2 €ddie$. After the fortnight if you didn't accept or pay with €ddie$, you pay back 1 €ddie$ + 100% interest = 2 €ddie$. <b>

<h3>Fortnight cooling off</h3>
<b>Whoever doesn't accept or pay for goods and services with €ddie$, has a forthnight to change their mind. After a fiat purchase is made, with info about €ddie$ and your receipt.<b>

  <h3>Receipt</h3>
  <b>Receipts come in many forms, digital, physical or a picture of a receipt. Ideally you should have a message with info about €ddie$, but your receipt is key. <a href="https://algoexplorer.io/tx/YYRM2TA3JMBBWH4JBVRGK4G6IECRDUOIJCJJKG2WKLUPKA743FOA"  target="_blank" style="background-color:orange">Starting from Wed, 24 May 2023 07:10:25 GMT</a> receipts that you still have can still be exchanged for €ddie$.<b>

<h3>Day 15</h3>
<b>Whoever didn't accept or pay for goods and services with €ddie$, after the forthnight period, if they accept or pay with €ddie$, they must pay n €ddie$ + 100% interest for previous purchases per receipt. <b>

<h3>Fortnight</h3>
<b>Whenever you start accepting and paying with €ddie$, you got to pay everyone back within a fortnight.<b>

<h3>Pay per minute</h3>
<b>If you don't pay everyone within the fortnight, you pay 1 €ddie$ per minute per person plus 100% interest, that you owe €ddie$.<b>
